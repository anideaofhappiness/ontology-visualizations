INDIANA PHILOSOPHY ONTOLOGY PROJECT
VISUALIZATIONS
-----------------------------------

The means of this portion of the InPhO project is to bring graphical
representations to the various data collections generated throughout
the lifetime of the Ontological project.


This project is broken up into three distinct sub-directories:

The data/ directory contains json files which further contain the data
used in generating graphical representations.

The lib/ directory contains libraries for various project tasks.
Currently, lib/ contains a library for generating and manipulating
graphical representations of data called d3, the jquery library, and
any additional javascript functions we create as necessary.

The projects/ directory contains representations of the datasets
contained within the data/ directory. The data should remain raw
and thus should be able to be rendered in various different ways
as desired.
